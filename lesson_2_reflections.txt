What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
you mark the directory for git, to identify it as a new repository, in order
to git start creating a following of the changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
the working area would let you mark the work that you are going to
commit to the repository, in this way you can have a previous step
in the commit process, that would help you to better organice your work or
even make changes that won't affect the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?
I think that one possibility is to check how many files are going to be
included in the commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
when creating an alternative version of the project, maybe when you are willing
to work on an stable version of your code to show some new feature that will be
tested, but not as an official feature.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I think they really help a lot, because it's easy to get lost and forget what
was the origin of the branches, in this way you can track it and maybe in the
future, make a merge of the branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
When you merge two branches, you end with only one branch, that will have the
history of changes.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
it's just a common problem when working on teams
